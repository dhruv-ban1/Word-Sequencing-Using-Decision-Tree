# Word Sequencing ML Project

## Overview

This project is part of the CS771 Introduction to Machine Learning course at IIT Kanpur. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning algorithm to guess words based on their character bigrams. The algorithm should be capable of training on a provided dictionary and making predictions on an unseen dictionary.

## Project Structure

- `submit.py`: Main Python script containing the `my_fit` and `my_predict` functions.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python packages required to run the project.
- `data/`: Directory containing the public dictionary file (`dictionary.txt`).
- `models/`: Directory where trained models are saved.
